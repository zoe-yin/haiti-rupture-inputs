Thu Sep 26 00:19:11, Info:  In your parameter file, you have specified a non-positive interval for "checkpointinterval" . This mechanism is deprecated and may be removed in a future version of SeisSol. Consider disabling the whole module by setting "checkpoint" to 0 instead by adding "checkpoint = 0" to the "output" section of your parameter file instead. 
Thu Sep 26 00:19:11, Info:  The field "printintervalcriterion" is no longer in use. You may safely remove it from your parameters file. 
Thu Sep 26 00:19:11, Info:  Disabling the wavefield output by setting "outputformat = 10" is deprecated and may be removed in a future version of SeisSol. Consider using the parameter "wavefieldoutput" instead. To disable wavefield output, add "wavefieldoutput = 0" to the "output" section of your parameters file. 
Thu Sep 26 00:19:11, Info:  The field "printintervalcriterion" is no longer in use. You may safely remove it from your parameters file.
